# CS6910-A3
Programming assignment 3 done as part of CS6910 - Fundamentals of Deep Learning

## Goal

To build a Seq2Seq model for text transliteration from English to Indian languages, using the [Aksharantar dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uRKU4as2NlS9i8sdLRS1e326vQRdhvfw/view?usp=share_link) released by [AI4Bharat](https://ai4bharat.org/).

For running all code, the zipped data is expected to be downloaded and extracted to a subdirectory named `data`. Code may be changed to get the data from other paths as well.
